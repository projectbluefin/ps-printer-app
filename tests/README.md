# Payload and print-path verification

`core-payload.sh` verifies the driver and PPD payload of a real ps-printer-app OCI
image and proves that a submitted job travels the intended IPP, filter and socket
backend path. It is the evidence half of
[projectbluefin/ps-printer-app#4](https://github.com/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app/issues/4);
it checks an image, never repository source text.

## What it proves

1. **Payload presence and closure.** Every entry in `payload-manifest.txt` exists in
   the image. Executables must resolve their runtime closure: `ldd` reports no
   missing shared library for ELF binaries, and a script's shebang interpreter must
   be installed. PPD archives must extract PostScript, sampled at their first,
   middle and last entry so a truncated archive cannot pass.
2. **The application uses the payload.** The generic PostScript driver is offered
   and at least `MIN_DRIVERS` drivers are enumerated, so the Foomatic and HPLIP PPD
   archives are wired into driver selection and not just shipped.
3. **A real job prints.** The container is started on the host network, a printer
   is added over IPP with the CUPS socket device scheme pointing at a TCP sink on
   the host, and the web interface's test page action submits a job. The captured
   bytes must carry a PostScript page description (`%!PS-Adobe`, also accepted
   behind a PJL preamble), and the job must reach `completed`.
4. **State survives a restart.** The container is restarted with the same state
   volume; the printer, its driver selection and the persisted state directory must
   all still be there.

## What it does not prove

Physical paper output, because no printer hardware is available. "The job completed
and PostScript bytes reached the socket sink" is the limit of what the image can be
asked without a printer.

## Running it

```sh
tests/core-payload.sh
```

`IMAGE` selects the image, `RUNTIME` the container runtime, `PORT` the application
port (the sink uses `PORT + 1000`), `MIN_DRIVERS` the enumeration floor juggled
above, and `IMAGE_PULL=1` forces a pull. The default image is
`ghcr.io/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app:latest`.

To verify a build of this tree instead of a published image, build the FSDK image
and run the full verification:

```sh
just build     # tags ghcr.io/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app:build
just verify    # validate, no-devel check, core-appliance.sh, print-routes.sh, core-payload.sh, foomatic-pin.sh, instance-isolation.sh
```

`just verify` runs the suites against the `:build` tag (see `docs/fsdk-ci.md`).
The manifest, not this script, is what has to be updated when the graph changes
where the payload lands.

## Appliance verification

`core-appliance.sh` starts the built image as a user would (nonroot, host network,
a state volume) and checks from the host: the web interface answers as nonroot
65532:65532; the entrypoint seeds its state; IPP answers a Get-Printer-Attributes
request (`ipp-request.py`, a minimal IPP client, so no client tool in the image is
trusted) for a printer added with the generic PostScript driver; an IPP Print-Job of
`testpage.ps` completes and PostScript reaches `socket-sink.py`; and TERM, a dead
required child and an invalid `PORT` stop the appliance with 143, a failure and 64,
while persisted state survives. `IMAGE` and `PORT` (default 18000) select the image
and port.

## PIN-protected printing

`foomatic-pin.sh` ([#14](https://github.com/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app/issues/14))
checks that an OEM PostScript queue turns a PIN into the job-level JCL of its PPD,
using the Foomatic `Ricoh/PS/Ricoh-Aficio_2045_PS.ppd` from the shipped archive.
Inside the image it asserts that the PPD routes PostScript through `foomatic-rip`
and declares the PIN, user code and job type as command line options, then drives
`foomatic-rip` directly: a custom and an enumerated PIN/user code must both reach
the locked print JCL (`/lppswd(...)def`, `/usrcode(...)def`, `{setuserinfo}`,
`{secureprint}`), while the PPD defaults must emit no secure print and a locked
print without a PIN must not invent one. From the host it then adds a printer
with that driver pointing at `socket-sink.py`, submits `testpage.ps` over IPP with
the PIN, user code and `job-type=locked-print`, and requires the JCL in the
captured bytes, the job to reach `completed`, and neither secret in the
application log or the container log. It proves the JCL reaches the device URI,
not that a printer honours it. `IMAGE`, `NAME` and `PORT` (default 18040, sink
`PORT + 1000`) select the image, container name and port.

## Instance isolation

`instance-isolation.sh` starts two instances of the image on the host network,
each with its own `PORT`, state volume and `PRINTER_APP_INSTANCE`, and one without
`PRINTER_APP_INSTANCE`. The named instances must both serve, report their distinct,
sanitized names over IPP Get-System-Attributes (`ipp-request.py`) and in the web
interface title, and advertise them as `_ipps-system._tcp` on their own port with
their avahi-daemon; the unnamed one must keep `PostScript Printer Application`. The
entrypoint must refuse with 64 an instance name with nothing usable, `PORT` 0, 65536
and an overlong number, and a state volume, or a directory of its layout, that UID
65532 cannot write, printing the `podman unshare chown` that fixes it. Discovery
from another host and USB access are not verified (see
[docs/state-and-device-isolation.md](../docs/state-and-device-isolation.md)).
`IMAGE`, `PORT` (default 18080; `PORT`..`PORT+2` are used) and `NAME_PREFIX`
(container names, default `ps-printer-app-inst`) select the image, ports and names.

## The manifest

`payload-manifest.txt` is the list of driver, filter, backend, interpreter and PPD
providers this application promises, with the source of each promise. It is the one
place to change when the payload contract changes, and the only place a reviewer
has to read to see what the image is expected to contain. The PostScript-only scope
is the one exclusion the upstream source itself makes: the non-PostScript Foomatic
manufacturer PPDs are removed before the archive is generated
(`elements/printer-app/foomatic-ps-ppds.bst`).

## Unit tests

### Running

```sh
make test
```

The tests build with a plain C compiler only. PAPPL, CUPS, libppd,
libcupsfilters and libpappl-retrofit do **not** need to be installed.

### What is covered

`tests/test_ps_autoadd.c` covers `ps_autoadd()` in `ps-printer-app.c`, the
callback that decides whether a discovered printer is auto-added and which
driver it gets.

`ps_autoadd()` is compiled and linked from the real `ps-printer-app.c` - the
`main()` in that file is skipped via `-DPS_PRINTER_APP_NO_MAIN` - so the
control flow under test is the shipped one, not a copy of it.

Regression under test: `prBestMatchingPPD()` returns `NULL` when it finds
neither a matching driver nor a usable device ID. `ps_autoadd()` used to
`strcmp()` that result unconditionally, which crashed the whole PAPPL service
on an unsupported printer.

### The test doubles

`tests/stubs/pappl-retrofit.h` shadows the real `<pappl-retrofit.h>` for the
test build only, and the test supplies its own `prBestMatchingPPD()` and
`prSupportsPostScript()`. Both answer for the device ID of the scenario
currently under test and refuse anything else, so a wrong device ID reaching
them fails a case instead of passing silently.

That means these tests pin `ps_autoadd()`'s own decision logic - including
every route into the former crash - but they do **not** exercise the real PPD
lookup or the real device ID parser. End-to-end behaviour, including the
driver that a specific physical printer actually gets, still has to be proven
by printing through a real image.

### Adding cases

Append to the `cases[]` table in `main()`: the device ID to pass in, what each
stubbed helper answers for it, the driver `ps_autoadd()` must return (`NULL`
for none), and how many PPD lookups it should make.

## The graph contract

`fsdk-contract.sh` checks this repository against fsdk-containers' printing-base
consumer contract (`docs/skills/printing-base.md`) so that "one CUPS artifact
owner" is enforced rather than assumed. It runs in `just validate`, on every pull
request, where nothing is built.

```sh
tests/fsdk-contract.sh                        # declarations only, no BuildStream
tests/fsdk-contract.sh --graph <names-file>   # plus the resolved graph, or -
```

The declaration checks need no BuildStream: one junction to fsdk-containers at a
pinned commit with no patches, `overrides` or options of its own; FSDK referenced
only as `fsdk-containers.bst:freedesktop-sdk.bst:...`; every remote source pinned
to an immutable ref; no element of this repository owning a CUPS stack component;
no patch staged by an element; and `core-runtime.bst` still composing runtime
domains only. `--graph` takes what `just bst show --deps all --format '%{name}'
oci/ps-printer-app.bst` prints, and requires `fsdk-containers.bst:printing/base.bst`
to be the only CUPS provider in it.

`fsdk-contract-test.sh` is the regression test for that check: it runs it against
the real graph, then against a scratch copy with each invariant broken in turn, and
fails if any of those broken graphs is accepted. `just validate` runs it before it
trusts the graph verdict, so a check that stopped rejecting cannot pass as a green
pull request; `just verify-contract` runs it on its own. It needs no BuildStream,
container runtime or network.

## Print-route verification

`print-routes.sh` ([#10](https://github.com/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app/issues/10))
drives the two filter routes of the image through to `socket-sink.py`, submitting a
generated one-page PDF from the host with `ipp-request.py` and raising the
application log to Informational through the web interface so each job's filter
chain is on record:

- **PDF to vector PostScript.** A printer on the generic PostScript driver must
  complete the job through `pdftops` with no raster filter, and deliver PostScript
  written by Ghostscript `ps2write` that starts with `%!PS-Adobe-3.0`, declares and
  paints one page and ends with `%%EOF`.
- **HPLIP `hpps` secure printing.** A printer on the HPLIP
  `hp-color_laserjet_m553-ps.ppd` driver, whose `*cupsFilter` is `hpps` and which
  declares `HPPinPrnt` and the four `HPFIDigit`..`HPFTDigit` PIN digits (offered over
  IPP as `secure-printing` and `first-digit`..`fourth-digit`), prints a plain job and
  a PIN job. Both must complete through `hpps` and carry its PJL job header; only the
  PIN job may carry `@PJL SET HOLD=ON`, `HOLDTYPE=PRIVATE` and `HOLDKEY=<pin>`, and
  neither the application log nor the container log may record its PIN options.

It proves the PIN reaches the device URI, not that a printer holds the job. `IMAGE`,
`NAME` and `PORT` (default 18060, sinks `PORT + 1` and `PORT + 2`) select the image,
container name and port; `just verify-routes` runs it against the `:build` tag.
