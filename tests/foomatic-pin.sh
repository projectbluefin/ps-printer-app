# Foomatic-RIP PIN job verification for the ps-printer-app OCI image.
#
# The README promises that the manufacturer PostScript PPDs shipped in the
# image are usable, "in most cases PIN-protected printing".  A PIN-protected
# PostScript queue is not a plain PostScript queue: the PPD carries
# "*FoomaticRIPOption ... CmdLine A" options and the job-level JCL is emitted
# by foomatic-rip, which has to be present, has to be found through the PPD's
# "*cupsFilter:" line, and has to be handed the job's vendor option values.
# Checking that the foomatic-rip binary exists checks none of that.
#
# This test therefore exercises the feature the way a user reaches it:
#
#   * --in-image extracts a representative OEM PostScript PPD that carries the
#     PIN options out of the shipped PPD archive and drives foomatic-rip
#     directly, so the JCL the filter emits for a given option set is pinned
#     down deterministically and the negative cases are covered;
#   * the default mode submits a real IPP job with the PIN options set to a
#     printer whose device URI is a TCP socket sink, so the same JCL is proven
#     to survive the whole spooling chain, and checks that the PIN does not
#     end up in the application's diagnostics.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/foomatic-pin.sh             verify one image end to end
#   tests/foomatic-pin.sh --in-image  filter chain proof only, run inside the image
#
# Environment:
#   IMAGE       image reference to verify
#               (default ghcr.io/projectbluefin/ps-printer-app:latest)
#   RUNTIME     container runtime (default podman)
#   NAME        container name (default ps-printer-app-foomatic-pin)
#   PORT        printer application port (default 18040), the sink uses PORT+1000
#   IMAGE_PULL  set to 1 to pull IMAGE even when it already exists locally
#
# What this can and cannot claim: it proves that the shipped filter chain turns
# the configured PIN and user code into the job-level JCL of the OEM PPD and
# that the result reaches the device URI.  It does not prove that a printer
# honours that JCL, and it is not physical validation - no printer hardware is
# available to anyone working on this repository.

# The representative OEM PPD: a Ricoh PostScript PPD from the Foomatic
# database, which is the family the PIN support in the PPD files exists for.
# It declares a locked print job type, a numeric PIN and a numeric user code,
# all of them Foomatic command line options, and the locked print job type
# emits the "{secureprint}" and "{setuserinfo}" operators.  The Aficio 2045 is
# used rather than, say, the Aficio 2051 because PAPPL refuses to create a
# printer from PPDs whose full-bleed sizes have an imageable area larger than
# the paper ("Invalid driver bottom/top margins value"), so such a PPD cannot
# reach a real queue.
